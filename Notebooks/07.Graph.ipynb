    "Consider that you start at node A. The discovery time of this node will be 1 as it is the first node. As we go deep into the graph, keep incrementing this number. When we reach a node which has no outgoing edge, we consider that the discovery of this node is complete, thats when we mark it as finish time. As we come one level up after completed discovery, we still keep on incrementing this time untill the end of algorithm. This time can be imaginary and we dont have to keep track of it. Its just the order in which we discover and finish discovering a node. Thus the source will be the first one to be discovered and last one to be finished in its own tree. \n"
