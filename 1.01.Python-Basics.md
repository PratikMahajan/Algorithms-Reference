# Python Basics

## Dictionaries

### Sorting a Dictionary with Key or Value

**Sort by Key**
```python
result = OrderedDict(sorted(unsorted.items(), key= lambda x:x[0]))
```

**Sort by Value**
```python
result = OrderedDict(sorted(unsorted.items(), key= lambda x:x[1]))
```

**Get items in Sorted Order**
```python
result = [unsorted[key] for key in sorted(unsorted.keys())]
```

### Ordered Dict

```python
import collections
orderes_dict = collections.OrderedDict() 
```

**Can also take existing dictionary (won't order the dictionary by itself)**

### Default Dict

```python 
import collections
dictionary = collections.defaultdict(set) # Replace 'set' with any data structure of choice
```

Creates a dictionary with default value(data-type). eg. list, set, dict, etc <br/>
It is accessed as a normal dictionary 

### Dictionary Operations 

**Delete a key in dictionary**

```python
del d[key]  # d is the name of dictionary
```

## Heaps

Inbuilt heap data structure is a `min-heap` i.e. it returns smallest item of the list

**Import the built-in heap using**
```python
import heapq
```
**Create a heap from list**
```python
heapq.heapify([])
```
**Insert an item into the heap**
```python
heapq.heappush([],item)
```
**Return the smallest item from the heap**
```python
heapq.heappop([])
```
**Insert an element into heap and return the smallest element**
```python
heapq.heappushpop([],item)
```

To convert the heap into `max-heap` (return the maximum element on `pop()`, just convert all the values into -ve while inserting

## SET


### Add
`.add(x)` \
It adds the element to the set and returns 'None'.

### Remove
`.remove(x)` \
This operation removes element x from the set. \
If element  does not exist, it raises a `KeyError`. \
The `.remove(x)` operation returns 'None'.

### Discard
`.discard(x)` \
This operation also removes element x from the set.  \
If element  does not exist, it **does not** raise a `KeyError`. \
The `.discard(x)` operation returns 'None'.

### Pop
`.pop()` \
This operation removes and return an arbitrary element from the set.  \
If there are no elements to remove, it raises a `KeyError`. 

### Union
`.union()` \
The .union() operator returns the union of a set and the set of elements in an iterable.  \
Sometimes, the | operator is used in place of .union() operator, but it operates only on the set of elements in set. \
Set is immutable to the .union() operation (or | operation). \
Usage:
```python3
ans= s.union(y)
# Returns a set which is union of 's' and 'y'
```

### Intersection 
`.intersection()`
The .intersection() operator returns the intersection of a set and the set of elements in an iterable. \
Sometimes, the & operator is used in place of the .intersection() operator, but it only operates on the set of elements in set. \
The set is immutable to the .intersection() operation (or & operation). \
Usage:
```python3
ans= s.intersection(y)
# Returns a set which is intersection of 's' and 'y'
```


### Difference
`.difference()`
The tool .difference() returns a set with all the elements from the set that are not in an iterable. \
Sometimes the - operator is used in place of the .difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set. \
Set is immutable to the .difference() operation (or the - operation). \
Usage:
```python3
ans= s.difference(y)
# Returns a set which has all the elements of 's' which are not in 'y'
```

### Symmetric Difference
`.symmetric_difference()`
The .symmetric_difference() operator returns a set with all the elements that are in the set and the iterable but not both. \
Sometimes, a ^ operator is used in place of the .symmetric_difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set. \
The set is immutable to the .symmetric_difference() operation (or ^ operation). \
Usage: 
```python3
ans= s.symmetric_difference(y)
# Returns a set which has all the elements of 's' and 'y' without the common elements
```

### Mutations

##### Update
`.update()` or `|= ` \
Update the set by adding elements from an iterable/another set.

##### intersection_update() 
`.intersection_update()` or `&=` \
Update the set by keeping only the elements found in it and an iterable/another set.

##### difference_update()
`.difference_update()` or `-=` \
Update the set by removing elements found in an iterable/another set.

##### symmetric_difference_update()
`.symmetric_difference_update()` or `^=` \
Update the set by only keeping the elements found in either set, but not in both.

## Regex

**Import regex library using** 
```python
import re
```

**Compile Regex**
```python
regex = re.compile('your_regex_here')
```

**Replace using Regex**
```python
import re 
regex = re.compile('your_regex_here')
string = regex.sub("replace_with_this", your_string)
```
